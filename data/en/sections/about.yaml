summary: | 
  I'm a self-taught programmer who loves R, Shiny, fantasy football, and carving pumpkins ðŸŽƒ.

  By day, I'm an engineer for Zelus Soccer. I started [DynastyProcess.com](https://dynastyprocess.com) 
  and [ffverse](https://ffverse.com), maintain [nflverse](https://github.com/nflverse), and mentor at 
  [R4DS Slack Community](https://r4ds.io). 

  In past lives, I have been a: residential property manager, construction data analyst, fantasy football 
  writer, live-coding streamer, marathon rower, adult rowing coach, and more.

  Away from my keyboard, I enjoy skiing, weightlifting, rowing, cooking, travelling, and hanging out with 
  my dog Jasper.

  Here's what I'm [currently up to](/now)
