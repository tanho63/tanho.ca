<p>I set out reading this book hoping to understand the metaprogramming chapter, and ended up learning a bunch of other stuff along the way!
Here‚Äôs a non-exhaustive list of things I learned from each of the sections of Advanced R:</p>
<div id="i---foundations" class="section level3">
<h3>I - Foundations:</h3>
<ul>
<li>I notice that I use the switch function a ton now, where previously I used if-else nests.</li>
<li>I use condition-handling to pass errors back to the user of my Shiny apps now.</li>
<li>I now know what an Environment is and where and why R would look for something. (This helps both in function-writing and debugging!)</li>
<li>I write a heck of a lot of functions (this ties into II: Functional Programming, of course)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="ii---functional-programming" class="section level3">
<h3>II - Functional Programming</h3>
<ul>
<li>I map the crap out of everything now (if I didn‚Äôt before, it‚Äôs way worse now!), and have learned to use functions in a ton of different ways.</li>
<li>I now understand what a function factory is, and what to do if a function somehow returns me a function instead (as opposed to panicking about it!)</li>
<li>I now know about a series of modifiers to help adjust function behaviours (memoise, quietly, safely, possibly) - although I use tryCatch as much as I do these.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="iii---oop" class="section level3">
<h3>III - OOP</h3>
<ul>
<li>I wrote a package that uses S3! It‚Äôs cool to minimize the user interface for multiple platforms and the mental load accompanying.</li>
<li>I still lean to using the explicit ‚Äúswitch‚Äù function a lot instead of writing out a useMethod call. May be a habit/pattern worth breaking in the future.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm now comfortable USING an R6 package - I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôd reach for an R6 system now but the whole ‚Äúfunction$method‚Äù thing doesn‚Äôt scare me anymore</li>
<li>S4? wot that</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="iv-metaprogramming" class="section level3">
<h3>IV Metaprogramming</h3>
<ul>
<li>I now know how to pass expressions to tidyverse stuff!</li>
<li>I now know where to look in the Metaprogramming and how to intepret the text.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="v-techniques" class="section level3">
<h3>V Techniques</h3>
<ul>
<li>Debugging: I now know how to use browser, and love it! Also debug()!</li>
<li>Performance measure/improve: still don‚Äôt do a ton of this, even though I‚Äôm a shiny dev. I feel like I should care more but I mostly work with smaller data (sub 1,000,000 rows) right now.</li>
<li>I ‚Ä¶ still don‚Äôt know C++ or Rcpp. ü§∑</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="toy-code" class="section level2">
<h2>Toy Code</h2>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)
library(rlang)

grouping_variables &lt;- switch(
  params$group_type,
  &quot;S&quot; = exprs(CraftCode, starts_with(&quot;Product&quot;), ModelCode, Elevation),
  &quot;B&quot; = exprs(starts_with(&quot;Rate&quot;)),
  &quot;P&quot; = exprs(starts_with(&quot;Part&quot;))
)
  
null_bids &lt;- bids %&gt;%
  group_by(SupplierID, ProjectID, !!!grouping_variables) %&gt;%
  slice_max(LastModDate) %&gt;%
  ungroup() %&gt;%
  select(!!!grouping_variables, ProjectID, SupplierAID, SupplierName, UnitPrice) %&gt;%
  left_join(lowest_bids, by = as.character(grouping_variables))</code></pre>
<p>Metaprogramming - how to pass expressions into select statements. Also example of switch.</p>
