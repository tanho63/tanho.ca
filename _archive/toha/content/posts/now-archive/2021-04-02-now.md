A full year of quarantine marked off the calendar, and I'm finding myself angry, irritable, frustrated, and burnt out. I've been diligently pushing things that I know are out of my control into a bucket of acceptance, and the bucket is overflowing.

I'm struggling with the idea that normality is still so far away - another month of "lockdown" is just around the corner.

I'm frustrated at how different the attitudes are between various people, both around me and globally. We're well on our way to the third wave of the pandemic, and everyone is so tired of what's going on - I can't help but think less of those who've stopped trying. I feel like those around me have given up. Vaccines feel far away.

Things feel bleak. I'm burnt out and depressed, and have to think about how I want to spend my very limited amount of mental energy each day - a lot like spoon theory, I guess.

Twitch streams have been bright spots for me, and very useful as a commitment device for continuing to schedule stuff.
