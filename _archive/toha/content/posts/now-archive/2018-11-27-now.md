## Things That I'm Focusing On
I started the year with setting up a bevy of goals, some of which felt unattainable - specifically, weighing 200 lbs and rowing a 7 minute 2K test. This was pretty ambitious [delusional?] for a guy weighing ~275 pounds with a previous best of 9 minutes. 

Well, I'm a heck of a lot closer than I thought after eleven months (215 lbs and 7:22), so I've doubled down on those goals and am determined to do my damnedest to hit those marks by Dec 31 of this year. Wish me luck! 

###  Crazy Bear Rowing Challenge!

I'm pursuing the [Crazy Bear Rowing Challenge](https://www.facebook.com/events/490206661488210/): complete 30 erg half marathons in 45 days. My fitness has come so far since the beginning of the year and this challenge seems like the perfect way to keep me motivated into the holiday season. As of this writing, I'm behind schedule - so I gotta get back to erging! 

You can follow along with my progress on [my Concept2 profile](https://log.concept2.com/profile/1208142) or on the [challenge tracker spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ok7A6HTImZ_0vSLofwfIENOX1S7dSKNfn-ECPeZ9WjM/edit?fbclid=IwAR1ZJNxPaMGa84dvcD7oN5KYaA9gJRS2xFrglrXt4GUzIiQTVt5FTcaCpDc#gid=0)!

### Won the Male Rec Rower of the Year Award!

I was recently recognized as one of the ORC Rec Rowers of the Year! The recognition is nice - but I think the journey has been even better. Rowing has been a lot of things to me this year, and I've needed every single one of them: 

- A beautiful and peaceful refuge from struggles on dry land 
- An endlessly demanding test of physical and technical ability challenging me to do better with every single stroke
- An opportunity to grow my confidence, patience, and leadership skills as a coach
- An amazing group of friends always ready to catch up over beers

### Coaching Workshop!

I recently attended [RCA Coach Workshop Weekend 2](https://www.rowontario.ca/education/coach/rca-coach/) and got a lot of inspiration for coaching rec rowing. Some [serious] training plans are in the works for ORC Rec Rowers this year, and we're going to kick ass! 

## Things That Are On The Backburner

I had ambitions to build more tools for my DynastyDashboard.com project, but that's been placed on the backburner while I get after my physical goals. I'm thinking about how I want to grow the site - it'll always include the Excel tools and Google Sheets but I'm starting to consider writing about dynasty game theory, process-based team management, and building better/more competitive leagues. 

I'm still actively managing my dynasty teams [pushing the playoffs in three of four leagues] and updating player values on the site monthly. It's just the R&D that is on hold...unless inspiration strikes!
