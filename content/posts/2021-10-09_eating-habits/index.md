I stepped on the scale today and realized I had hit a milestone: I've lost fifty
pounds since starting my weight loss efforts five months ago. It's a nice, if
somewhat bittersweet milestone to hit on this weight loss journey - I recorded
a pretty similar milestone in 2018 while going from 275 lbs to 200 lbs. Life
happened (happens, I guess) and while I'm a tad bitter, there's some comfort in
the confidence that I'm capable of reaching my goals when I put the effort in.

I wanted to write down a mental model that I've been experimenting with around
dieting, eating habits, and weight loss. While this post is not a formally
qualified opinion and does not constitute medical advice, it feels like a useful
mental model for understanding the many varied paths to the same goal. 

### Levers to use towards a caloric deficit

Losing weight involves consuming less calories than you expend over a significant 
amount of time[^1] - aka "caloric deficit". In most cases (and especially among 
those with a lot of weight to lose), adjusting your eating habits is a much 
bigger driver of caloric deficits than purely exercising (although exercise is 
good and useful). So let's define for ourselves the work (in a mechanical sense)
as being "eating a caloric deficit".

Now that we've defined work, we can frame all "diets" as three types of levers 
(in the "simple machines" sense above) that we can apply force (i.e. effort, time,
discipline) to: ***what*** you eat, ***when*** you eat, and ***how much*** you 
eat.

- **What you eat** covers all kinds of food restrictions, including low carb
  (keto, Atkins etc), low fat, high protein, vegetarian/vegan, paleo, or 
  otherwise. These primarily work because there's a property about that food
  that makes it hard to overeat - in keto, you eat more fats and your brain
  thinks you're satiated before you reach a certain calorie threshold, while in
  low fat and/or vegetarian diets you eat more greens and proteins so that your
  stomach becomes full before it can take in a certain number of calories etc.
  This works - the primary mechanism for me losing weight in 2018 was eating
  a keto diet and being ruthless about cutting out carbs. 

- **When you eat** covers all kinds of fasting - intermittent, extended, or
  otherwise. The primary mechanism here is eating fewer meals, so while you do eat
  to fullness you end up eating less calories than you would have if you'd eaten
  three meals. In practice your appetite is also somewhat diminished (or your
  stomach "shrinks") so your fullness threshold happens more quickly and at a lower
  calorie threshold. This can also work on a broader scale as I'm doing right now
  in 2021, where over the course of a seven day week I fast on three days - 
  effectively reducing my calorie intake by 40%. 

- **How much you eat** covers calorie, macro, or portion control for each meal.
  If this is the lever you're using, you're doing the classic "track your calories
  at each meal" methodology and being precise about how much you take in at each
  meal - think of classic apps like My Fitness Pal, IIFYM etc. 

All three of these levers, when properly applied[^2] within the goal of caloric
deficit, successfully lead to weight loss over time with adherence. If you use 
none of them, you're eating the Standard American Diet (SAD being an apt acronym). 

Some levers are easier for some people to use than others - the one that is 
easiest for me may not be the easiest for someone else. Heck, the one that's 
easiest for me today (when to eat/fasting) is not the same as the one that 
worked the last time (what to eat/keto). In 2018, I ground out a keto strategy 
to some success, but found food boringly repetitive and socializing difficult. 
I'm finding fasting easier to stick to this time around, because when I do eat I
don't need to worry about "what" I'm eating or "how much" I'm eating at each 
meal - I can eat until I'm full when I do eat and eat whatever I'm craving. 

You can apply force on these levers with varying degrees of intensity (fasting 
for longer, reducing portion sizes more, cutting out more foods), and you can 
use one, two, or three levers at a time. It is mentally draining to use two or
all three levers intensely at once - i.e. keto + one meal a day is very tough to
stick to, as I've found out - it could be doable in the short term as a treatment
but feels so unsustainable as a long term plan. 

If you can strive to put consistent effort into just one of these levers at a time, 
you should be able to stick to that pattern for a longer period of time - and 
adherence to a caloric deficit leads to more successful weight loss.

[^1]: There are some other hypotheses about why obesity exists, including the 
carbohydrate-insulin model, but I don't personally find them very convincing 
after experimenting with them. I'm not sure I'm the right person to discuss those
without having done the research.

[^2]: All three levers have possible ways to fail at the goal of eating a 
caloric deficit - you can still indulge in too many calories while eating keto, 
you can binge eat when fasting so as to wipe out your efforts, and you can be 
poor/ineffective at tracking your calories at each meal (or misjudge the correct
calorie numbers etc).
