It's been a while since I updated this - and it's been a heckuva eventful summer:

- I left my job at ABIC, took a month off, and then joined [Zelus Analytics](https://zelusanalytics.com). Caivan and ABIC meant a lot to me and I'm so grateful for everything I'd learned while I was there!  
- I [gave a talk](https://tanho.ca/rsconf2022-talk) at RStudio Conference! It was incredible to meet so many of the wonderful friends I have made online.
- I travelled to Toulouse and Milan to meet with my new team and to see the inner workings of Toulouse FC & AC Milan. Seeing PSG vs Toulouse and the Milan Derby made it sink in that I'm finally realizing my dream of working in sports! 

I also:

- Lifted 4x per week for six months straight
- Played flag football and ultimate frisbee with OSSC
- Worked on some struggles with burnout and depression

Looking forward to the fall, and already starting to plan out what kind of skiing and travelling I can do this winter!
