2018 was an important year of my life - a catastrophic collapse of a long-term 
relationship led to a single-minded drive to rebuild my identity.

Along the way, I: 
- lost 75 pounds
- rowed over a million on-water meters
- helped coached a successful recreational rowing program
- got a dog (Jasper!)
- made a lot of new friends

2018 was good to me - and I'm excited to be moving forward on to 2019.

## Targets for 2019

- Weigh: 180 pounds and/or reach 20% body fat [currently 205 lbs, 30%] 
- Row: 7:00 2K 
- Row: 3:00:00 marathon 
- Train for masters rowing regattas, perform at level I can be proud of 
- Write articles for fantasy football 
- Eliminate credit card debt 
- Improve financial health
