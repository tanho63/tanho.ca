2024 has come to a close. What do I want to remember about it?

- I turned thirty this year. My twenty year old self would be proud of me, I think.

- I travelled a little less than last year: Toulouse, Bordeaux, Carcassonne, 
Philadelphia, Banff, Jasper, Calgary, Seattle, London, Newcastle, Manchester, and
Scotland. The Scotland road trip was a particular highlight and I can't wait to
go back. 

- I focused a lot on work, grinding my way to a second promotion in two years 
(Senior MLE). I've been thinking a lot about how my role and career has evolved
over the last few years and how to balance individual contributions with 
leadership/mentorship/planning as I become more senior. 

- Zelus was acquired this year. It's been a little bit of an awkward transition,
but I appreciate the company being more financially stable overall. 

- I'm still doing a bit of freelance consulting work and figuring out how that
fits into my overall working life without becoming too much - thus far doing a 
much better job balancing that than my first go-round in 2020ish. 

- I attended three conferences: PositConf in Seattle, Shiny in Production in Newcastle,
and Statsbomb in Manchester. I tried really really hard to not give any talks this
year but somehow still got roped into giving a talk at Shiny in Production. 

- I got tested and treated for sleep apnea. It's made a fairly sizeable improvement
in my day to day outlook, I can't believe I was nerfing my brain for so long. I'm
still not very good at sleeping with the mask but I think that's improving over
time. 

- I'm continuing to work through ADHD medications and trying to find the one that 
helps me the best. I think that sleep apnea has had a substantial confounding
impact so I'm interested to see if previous medications work better now. 

- I attended pickup sports consistently this year and found myself enjoying the
activity and the camaraderie. A weekly pub night definitely helps with getting out
there, and I found myself enjoying ultimate frisbee and volleyball a lot more
than I'd expected! 

- I started swimming for exercise this winter and hope to continue it through 
next year, I'm enjoying it so far.

- I'm languishing a bit on physical self-care otherwise, weight is up to the highest
it's been. I need to take better care of myself and to eat better. 

- I appreciated Bluesky bringing back a lot of the global connectedness feeling!
My global friend groups feels so much stronger now that we're all on one platform
again. I still worry a little about loneliness - I'm not yet feeling like I've made
a lot of friends through pickup sports in a way that's filled the gap in local
connectedness that leaving rowing hurt. 

- I'm blogging again, a lot inspired by Bluesky being back to share those thoughts
with. My other side projects remain in a maintenance phase, and DynastyProcess
calculator app creeps ever closer to a sunset date.
