**2023 note**

I realized when I was going back and reorganizing my reflections that 
I never properly wrote out a year in review for 2019 (and that I'd done so for 
2018 and 2020). Jotting down some recollections now, pieced together from various 
snippets I had written and what I can still remember, for the sake of having 
something to look back on in the future.

In the same way that 2018 was a year of rebuilding my personal life, 2019 was a 
year of reinventing my professional life - in May I lost my job in sudden and 
humiliating fashion. 

I was coming off of [a lot of personal successes](/posts/reflections/2018) 
(physically, socially) in 2018, and my professional life had become an afterthought 
at this point...which must have been part of the impetus for what happened (I'll 
never know). I was still pretty vulnerable and fragile at this point, and losing 
the only career I had ever known since I was a child was yet another shatterpoint.

I was in denial for a while. I travelled to Vietnam to meet up with my parents,
trying to regain my bearings - it didn't help all that much - and then stayed in
my rented apartment until my emergency fund ran out midway through the summer, 
after which I had no other choice but to pack up and move home.

I threw all sorts of applications into the job mill, focusing on finding Excel 
and other more-data-centric jobs. I'd been building fantasy football spreadsheets
for quite a while by this point (since 2017) and had become extremely proficient
in Excel's PowerQuery suite for doing more database-like work, so I was pretty
hopeful that I could find a job in this space. 

A couple of uncomfortable summer months went by - coaching rowing gave it some
structure, interspersed with job applications and obsessing over various fantasy
football projects. I accepted a casual gig working for Dynasty League Football
as a writer, and contributed a couple of articles and projects there, but I 
learned that I wasn't much of a writer and that I was more of a data/tools person.

One of these personal projects was a dynasty trade calculator dashboard, which 
had a user facing Excel sheet and a backend written in PowerQuery. My friend Joe 
Sydlowski offered to write an R-based Shiny app front-end to the calculator to 
help make the sheets more accessible. I agreed, but as the development went on, 
I became such an annoying and needy product manager that I started bothering Joe 
into giving me access to the R code and teaching me how to edit and update the 
app so that I could make the changes I wanted to make. It wasn't long before I 
was hooked on R - first refactoring the app to use the tidyverse, then writing 
my own (Crystal Ball) from scratch, and my love of R only snowballed from there.

I finally landed a full-time role at Caivan Communities in October, which blended
my new aspirations in data work with my background and domain experience in real
estate / construction. Despite my own fears around imposter syndrome - I'd only 
been programming in R for a few months - I found myself in position to contribute
small R and Shiny tools right away, which felt so much more fulfilling than I'd
ever felt in property management.
