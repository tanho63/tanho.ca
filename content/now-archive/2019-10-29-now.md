## Things I'm Focusing On

I'm excited to be making the full-time dive into a data career - and that it's in real estate feels like a tremendous blessing, meshing my domain knowledge with my data dev passions. Thus far, it’s been everything I’d dreamed about!

A whole season of rowing has come and nearly gone - I've got some regrets about not making the most of it, especially since I had the opportunity to. I did train and lift far more than last year, bulking up and rebuilding some of that powerlifting strength I'd had, but I think it's about time for a serious cut as winter is approaching.
