## Things I'm Focusing On

- Incredibly excited to get back into the swing of rowing again - looking forward to both rowing and coaching.
- Regrouping on physical fitness - I've spent the past half-year undoing last year's progress and have to eliminate the new bad habits I've picked up.
- Got lots of data/FF projects to work on, as well as fantasy football articles waiting to be written.

Need to focus on one step at a time.
