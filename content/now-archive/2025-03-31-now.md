## working a lot

I'm plugging away at work, grinding out a few releases and onboarding some new teammates 
after our recent hiring cycle. I'm excited that our little soccer group has grown to 
six total engineers, and rather proud that I was promoted to Engineering Manager - 
although suddenly having five reports is definitely adding a load that I'll need to keep
an eye on to make sure I'm not burning out. The dream "50% IC 50% managing" balance is,
thus far, still a dream...

## staying active

I'm nailing down swimming and volleyball routines, which I'm pretty proud of so far.
I've taken up a weekly lesson in each of swimming and volleyball and manage two sessions
each outside of that, which is going super well even in the face of major work deadlines. 

## want to travel soon

I haven't booked any travel but I'm starting to get the itch again. I don't think there
is an on-site coming soon (although I'm mixed on whether I want to be travelling to the US
right now). Trying to get a break after pushing hard this last quarter, we'll see how that
goes.
