## Solitude for the holidays
I decided against flying out to Vietnam for the holidays this year after much 
internal debate, and so I'm spending the holidays in solitude with only Jasper
for company. I chose not to for a litany of reasons: don't have great memories 
in Vietnam, the family drama has been overwhelming in the past, exhausted and
not interested in the thirty hours of flying. I don't regret my choice, but I
also am now experiencing the downsides - namely, that I'm alone and feeling
socially isolated. I've been pretty solitary this whole year and it's starting
to feel more lonely.

## Reflecting

Being alone means I've had a lot of time to reflect. I decided to split my 
annual reflections into their [own posts](/tags/reflections) away from the usual 
"now" journalling and wrote about [2023 here](/posts/reflections/2023). 
Organizing those reflections into their own posts led me down a nice nostalgia
journey, especially since I hadn't written about 2019 in one single post before -
(so I retrospectively collected my [2019 reflections](/posts/reflections/2019) 
while I still have mostly vivid memories). I've found a lot of personal value 
in the annual reflections and thought it was a good reminder of how far I've 
come and what my perspective on each year has been like. I also still find 
journalling in public to be valuable - it's perhaps more vulnerable and more 
open than people are usually comfortable with, but I find it liberating.

## Dabbling with side projects

I'm trying to disconnect from work-work and have instead been trying to relax
a little by working on side projects that I feel like I've been neglecting. I've
let the muse decide, and apparently it has decided that I'm refactoring lots of
[piggyback](https://github.com/ropensci/piggyback) right now. I think the reason
I'm on it is because it has a broader reach than just NFL or just fantasy football
like my other projects, and I like the idea of being able to support more people
with it.

I'm also dabbling with setting up some self-hosted homelab right now. I upgraded
my [Framework laptop](https://frame.work) to a new CPU/mainboard this year 
(going from the 2020 era Intel i5-1135g7 CPU to 2023-era AMD 7840u) along with
battery and RAM upgrades (AMD only takes DDR5, so I'm now up to 64GB on this 
machine). Framework lets you turn the old mainboard/RAM into a standalone PC when
you upgrade (as part of the sustainabilty model) and so I've been dabbling a 
little with setting it up as a home server. We'll see how far I get.

I've also been messing about with this website and recently moved to a new blog
theme, [blowfish](https://blowfish.page). I switched because Toha started feeling
like I was resisting the core design goals of being a resume/portfolio website,
while blowfish feels more flexible to what I want my website to be.

I was excited to see someone interested in ffscrapr's Yahoo implementation, I'm 
looking forward to see how that progresses over the next few months.

Is physical fitness a side project? I'm trying to summon up the willpower to
get back into things. We'll see.

## Neglecting other side projects

As ever, by working on some projects I'm neglecting other projects - here is a 
short list of side projects I thought of in five minutes that I wanted to get 
to but haven't yet:
- push the nflverse internship project forward
- update how nflreadr's load_players and load_rosters are built so that 
  load_players is the ground truth for every player
- finish the half-open ffsimulator PR for adding a more realistic simulation
- add a Shiny app to ffsimulator (maybe document as part of shiny manifesto?)
- tackle bugs on ffscrapr
- tackle open issues on nflreadr
- push ffopportunity to CRAN

and blogposts I've thought about but haven't written:
- write a post on best practices for using Docker with R, since I've grown
  many opinions about that over the last year or so
- write a post about setting up my home server
- write a post to update my guide on setting up your own Shiny Server VM
  - and maybe re-record the video as well?
- continue transcribing old good tweets to blogposts now that I'm off of Twitter

  - https://twitter.com/_TanHo/status/1415709884021157891
    - write a post about my shiny manifesto: all shiny apps should be function logic
    combined into a package and called from an app. the app does not have to be 
    golem, it just needs to call the package functions

## Riding out the end of the fantasy season

I was in seven fantasy leagues this year: three dynasty leagues (JML, 48, DLP), 
three redraft leagues (SFB, Zelus, Ashbury), and one best ball league (Solar's 
Auction). 

I'm in the finals for three leagues (SFB, JML, DLP), third place game for one 
league (48), semifinal for one league (Ashbury), tracking for third place in the
best ball league, and I lost a relegation playoff in the Zelus league. It's 
especially exciting that I'm in the SFB finals - I think this is the deepest run
I've ever managed there - and especially frustrating that I got relegated in the
Zelus league.
