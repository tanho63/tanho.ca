## Travelling

A long summer of grind has wrapped up with a week in Seattle, where I got to do PositConf, Tidyverse Dev Day, and DuckCon. I'm glad to be able to meet up with so many friends and to make a few more, I've missed them since the last time I saw them in 2022. Also glad not to be speaking at conf this time, a lot more enjoyable to take things in at my own pace. Definitely drained the social battery built up over the course of the year, so I'm a little glad to be going home tomorrow. 

## Working on

Not been a great summer in terms of balance. Have been struggling a little, slumping and falling into the allure of grinding my way towards a promotion again. Experimenting a little with fasting again in conjunction with a little more cooking / less eating out (travel aside), in lieu of major athletic efforts. We'll see how things go.
