### Things that have my attention

This month's obsession was most definitely [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) - I've unwrapped a code puzzle and tackled it every day since December 1st! I'm very pleased to have completed every day's puzzle on the day it was released. I was staying up to solve it for quite some time, until it was taking 3+ hours each time...that was definitely too much. I've learned a ton about programming by doing these, including loops, recursion, and optimising for speed/minimal-memory. 

I've been enjoying Assassin's Creed Valhalla lately. 

I'm disappointed that Ontario is creeping back into lockdown - it definitely throws a bit of a wrench in my early-season skiing hobbies this year. 

It's gotten cold and lifting has been much harder to be motivated for - the bar is super duper cold!
