I'm a self-taught programmer who loves R, Shiny, NFL, and [carving pumpkins](/pumpkins). 

By day, I'm an Engineering Manager for [Teamworks Intelligence](https://teamworks.com/intelligence/) Soccer. 

I started [DynastyProcess](https://dynastyprocess.com), maintain [nflverse](https://github.com/nflverse) and [ffverse](https://ffverse.com), and mentor at [DSLC Slack Community](https://dslc.io). 

In past lives, I have been a: residential property manager, construction data  analyst, fantasy football writer, live-coding streamer, marathon rower, adult  rowing coach, and more.

Away from my keyboard, I enjoy playing volleyball, lifting weights, skiing, cooking, and hanging out with my dog Jasper.
