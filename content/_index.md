I'm a self-taught programmer who loves R, Shiny, NFL, and [carving pumpkins](/pumpkins). By day, 
I'm an ML Engineer for [Zelus Analytics](https://zelusanalytics.com) Soccer. 

I started [DynastyProcess](https://dynastyprocess.com) and [ffverse](https://ffverse.com), 
maintain [nflverse](https://github.com/nflverse), and mentor at [R4DS Slack Community](https://r4ds.io). 

In past lives, I have been a: residential property manager, construction data 
analyst, fantasy football writer, live-coding streamer, marathon rower, adult 
rowing coach, and more.

Away from my keyboard, I enjoy skiing, lifting weights, cooking, and hanging 
out with my dog Jasper.
