      <description>Lifting weights is the best way to build strength, which translates to peak power in rowing. This is a guide intended for the adult rec/masters rower looking to improve that strength (both over the offseason and as supplemental training during the rowing season.)
Philosophy Thoughts  &amp;ldquo;Better athletes are better rowers.&amp;rdquo;
 In targeting the average rec/masters rower, I&amp;rsquo;m making a few basic assumptions:
 Time is limited. We are working adults balancing busy schedules, not varsity athletes with the time to dedicate two-a-days six days per week specifically to rowing.</description>

      <description>The few short minutes before ORC Rec practices are often hectic as everyone rushes over after work, gets coach boats and equipment ready, and then hops into a boat. That said, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to add another wrench into the works this year - a short dynamic warmup to promote mobility and get ourselves ready for rowing.
Short Description Two sets of the following circuit:
 Halos (5 reps in each direction)</description>

      <description>This is a raw dump of video links from the old site. Some of them may be dead-links, I believe Streamable has a policy of deleting videos that haven&amp;rsquo;t been watched in a few months. I do still have these on a hard-drive somewhere if you&amp;rsquo;re really keen on seeing them.
